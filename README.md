# Etch-a-Sketch (Odin project)

This repo will house (and host) the Etch-a-Sketch project from The Odin Project.
It will use HTML, CSS and vanilla JavaScript.
CSS Grid will be used to create the sketch-grid.

## TODO
- [x] implement hover effect to change colour
- [x] add button to clear the grid and prompt for new dimensions of grid
- [] fix grid borders (inner borders are now doubled)
